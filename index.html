        <h1>Who Am I?</h3>
    <p style="margin: 35px;">Hey, My name is Yusuf, I'm a 3rd-year Computer Engineering student at Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University (AYBU).
        My main interests lie in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
        Beyond the world of technology, I have a deep passion for traveling Iâ€™ve had the chance to explore almost every part of both 
        Turkey and the United States, experiencing diverse cultures across these countries. <br><br>When it comes to my Computer Engineering journey, 
        I had the opportunity to intern at Belsis, where I focused on ERP software development and GIS systems. 
        This experience gave me hands-on exposure to enterprise-level software solutions and spatial data technologies,
        helping me strengthen my technical expertise and analytical thinking.
